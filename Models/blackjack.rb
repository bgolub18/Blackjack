	#Here's our plan:
	#Assign values to each card. Give options Hit, Stand, or Quit. Show one of the dealers cards
	#We might not actually include the dealer because that could be complicated
	#While playerScore != 21 do (for hitting)
	#We could also have a default of about 5 people at the table for simplicity
	#We probably can't do a split yet because that's hard
	#For HTML we could make each suit either red or black
	#We could maybe make like a repeat/loop command (I don't remember what it's called)
	#It will probably be a bunch of if or case statements
